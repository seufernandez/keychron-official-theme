# Loki Official
## Loki Official Dark Theme, a pretty dark theme based on Loki retro futuristic aesthetic

*All the colors present in the theme were extracted from Loki's TV show, using screenshots of beautiful scenes and capturing the colors using Figma's color picker :) 
<br/>

Check which color was extracted from each scene in this [Figma file!](https://www.figma.com/file/1sW02i6q47Iw7wiBmXa70G/Loki-Theme---color-inspirations-%F0%9F%8E%A8?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Kc3yjVXSfWNw59fr-1)
